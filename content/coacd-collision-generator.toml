    "**Threshold** - Concavity tolerance. Lower = more cuts/tighter hulls; higher = fewer, coarser hulls.",
    "**Max Convex Hulls** - Upper limit on number of hull pieces to output.",
    "**Max Hull Vertices** - Per-hull vertex cap after simplification.",
    "**Min Volume Threshold** - Minimum volume threshold as percentage of largest hull; smaller pieces are discarded.",
    "**MCTS Nodes** - Search breadth. Higher can improve fit at cost of time.",
    "**MCTS Iterations** - Search effort. Higher can improve fit at cost of time.",
    "**MCTS Depth** - Search depth. Controls how deep the Monte Carlo Tree Search explores.",
    "**Merge Sub-Hulls** - Enable post-processing to merge adjacent sub-hull components.",
    "**Preprocessing Mode** - Toggle between two preprocessing methods:",
    "  • **Geonode Mode** (COACD OFF): Uses Geonode Inflate and Geonode Resolution.",

    "Post-Processing - **Split Mesh with Cylinder**: draw from center to edge to define cylinder radius, then extrude along view.",
    "Post-Processing - **Split Mesh with Square**: draw diagonal to define square, then extrude along view to split.",
    "Post-Processing - **Use Child Objects as Colliders**: convert existing child objects to UCX_ colliders.",
    "Post-Processing - **Combine Colliders**: merge selected collision hulls into one.",
    "Post-Processing - **Mirror Collision Objects**: mirror across X/Y/Z with center threshold.",

  workflow_title = "Recommended Workflow"
  workflow_steps = [
    "**Mesh Quality** - Clean meshes result in clean collision. Use manifold meshes when possible for optimal results.",
    "**For Simple Meshes** - Start by applying a collider profile at the lowest quality preset. Gradually use a higher quality preset until the collision accuracy meets your needs.",
    "**For Complex Meshes** - If the collision doesn't yield good results at High Quality, split the mesh into separate objects, with each object having their own quality preset. Generate colliders for each piece individually.",
    "**Quality Preset Guidelines** - The Maximum preset is only for experimental usage, as it tends to create hundreds of colliders. The performance overhead of using hundreds of colliders starts to become a liability for game engines. It's better to stick to up to the High quality preset. If High doesn't work, you're better off splitting the mesh. For slower machines, it's recommended to use Medium quality as the highest.",
    "**Post-Processing** - Combine, Remove, and Mirror the colliders where needed using the built-in tools that come with the addon.",
    "**Iterative Refinement & Scalability** - This approach is highly efficient, as you only need to use a higher quality preset on the specific parts where the initial results are unsatisfactory, saving you from reprocessing the entire model. This method scales effectively for any object, from simple props to complex structures.",
