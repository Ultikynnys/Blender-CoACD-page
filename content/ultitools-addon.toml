# Tool-specific sections (detailed descriptions)
[tools]
  [tools.palette_manager]
    title = "Palette Manager"
    description = "Switching between colors is truly painful with Blender's current implementation, so I decided to streamline the palette system. I also added the ability to save/load palettes, so you can bring them with you in future projects. (Ctrl+Q for pie menu by default, you can rebind it)"
  
  [tools.mesh_analysis]
    title = "Mesh Analysis"
    description = "I can't believe this isn't a thing already in Blender, but seeing the state of your mesh with all its glorious problems is a feature I couldn't go without. Yes, it does detect overlapping faces as well."
  
  [tools.portfolio_renderer]
    title = "Portfolio Renderer"
    description = "I spent countless hours setting up the wireframe render for my projects, so this tool automates the entire process, including configuring the text, font, size, and material settings for AO and wireframe renders."
  
  [tools.lut_generator]
    title = "3D LUT Generator"
    description = "A surprisingly useful tool if you use 3D LUTs in your projects. Since various engines and platforms have different formats and requirements, this generator can be invaluable for any color correction tasks. There is also a 3D LUT visualizer, allowing you to see how it affects your target color space."
  
  [tools.sprite_sheet]
    title = "Sprite Sheet Creation"
    description = "As the name implies, this tool takes all the frames of the camera and stitches them into a single texture. It is a very useful tool for anyone looking to create sprite animations."
  
  [tools.text_animation]
    title = "Text Animation"
    description = "One of the most underrated tools in the add-on. Simply toggle and keyframe different texts on your text object (stored per text object). It even supports dynamic expressions and mathematical operations, requiring brackets {} for math expressions. Copy the settings to your selected text objects for reusability."
  
  [tools.uv_plus]
    title = "UV++"
    description = "Better UV layer controls-you can finally rearrange the UV layers, create a copy from a specific UV layer, and even copy the UV layout to selected objects (sadly, Blender's internal UV layer data transfer is broken)."
  
  [tools.fbx_exporter]
    title = "Game Ready FBX Exporter"
    description = "If I could count how many times I've had to struggle with the built-in exporter, I would be a millionaire. Since I use Unity and Unreal in my game development projects, I need a reliable tool for my models."
