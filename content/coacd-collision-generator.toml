    "**Threshold** - Concavity tolerance. Lower = more cuts/tighter hulls; higher = fewer, coarser hulls. Typical 0.03â€“0.20.",
    "**Max Convex Hulls** - Upper limit on number of hull pieces to output.",
    "**Resolution** - Voxel grid detail for preprocessing and CoACD; higher = more detail, slower.",
    "**Max Hull Vertices** - Per-hull vertex cap after simplification.",
    "**Merge Sub-Hulls** - Merge adjacent sub-hull components when possible.",
    "**Inflate Thickness** - Inflate mesh faces before voxelization. Set to 0 to disable.",
    "**Min Volume Threshold** - Minimum volume for creating a hull; smaller pieces are discarded.",
    "**MCTS Nodes/Iterations** - Search breadth and effort; higher can improve fit at the cost of time.",
