    "AnimPlus is an utility add-on for Blender animators. It streamlines various animation-related quirks and adds powerful animation tools that allow you to modify mocap and baked animations with ease.",
    "It unifies various Blender features into a single place, making your animation workflow a breeze."

  parameters = [
    "**Delta Offset** - Add your modified pose on top of an existing animation, even on baked animations.",
    "**Delta Offset All Keyframes** - Apply your current modified pose as an offset that affects all keyframes, perfect for aligning animations.",
    "**Copy/Paste Visual Pose** - Supercharged version of Blender's internal pose copy/paste that supports simulated and modifier-driven poses.",
    "**Replace Selected Bones** - Combine two actions into a single one, using the posed bone selection to define which bones get replaced, perfect for creating blended animations.",
    "**Naming Scheme Conversion** - Rigging diagnostics detect non-Blender naming schemes and suggest fixes so operators like X-mirrored copy/paste work on symmetrical armatures.",
    "**Apply Selected Scale** - Scale your armature to 1.0 while fixing your selected animations to work with the new scale, ideal for resolving export issues related to scale.",
    "**Clamp** - Add keyframes so your active action matches the timeline min/max; required by certain engines that need keyframes defined across the full timeline.",
    "**Snap** - Align your action so that the first keyframe is on frame 0.",
    "**Automatic Timeline Control** - Define per-action timelines that update automatically when you change actions.",
    "**Asset Library with Viewport Icon** - Take a snapshot of your viewport and use it as the asset library icon, making batch action creation much easier.",
    "**Remove Actions from UI** - Choose between clearing (default Blender behavior) or fully removing the action from your blend file."
