    "**Baking** is the act of turning surface details into textures. The modular design philosophy allows for easy baking of textures, **decals**, high to low poly, UDIMs and more, with the added benefit of **saving your setups for later use** using **Profiles**, like in Substance Painter."

    "**Bake Visualizer** — See your baked textures before you bake them! It dynamically adapts to your baking setup to show only the relevant textures.",
    "**Decal Baking** — Unique feature! Apply decals to your desired object's surface. Support for decal addons like decalMACHINE, DecalMaster, TrimFlow, Sanctus Library and UltiStamp.",
    "**Multi High to Low Baking** — Transfer surface details from high-poly to low-poly meshes. You can bake as many high-to-low combinations as you wish with one click!",
    "**Profiles** — Create your own bake setup profile. You can also save/load to external files for other projects.",
    "**Bake Post Processing** — Apply antialiasing, denoising, sharpening and more.",
    "**UDIM Baking** — Visualize your UDIM resolution before baking. UDIMs are automatically detected from UVs.",
    "**Bent Normals** — Control directional Specularity with Bent Normals.",
    "**Multi Texture Channel Packed Baking** — Bake multiple textures with a single click while having Full Control over texture channels with 23 unique bake types."
