    "Animation+ is a utility add-on for Blender animators. It streamlines common animation quirks and adds powerful tools that let you edit mocap and baked animations with ease.",
    "It brings several Blender animation features together in one place, making your workflow smoother and more consistent."

  parameters = [
    "**Delta Offset** - Add your modified pose on top of an existing animation, even on fully baked animations.",
    "**Delta Offset All Keyframes** - Apply your current pose as an offset across all keyframes, perfect for aligning animations.",
    "**Copy/Paste Visual Pose** - A supercharged version of Blender's built-in pose copy/paste that also supports simulated and modifier-driven poses.",
    "**Replace Selected Bones** - Combine two actions into one by using your posed bone selection to define which bones are replaced, perfect for creating blended animations.",
    "**Naming Scheme Conversion** - Rigging diagnostics detect non-Blender naming schemes and suggest fixes so tools like X-mirrored copy/paste work correctly on symmetrical armatures.",
    "**Apply Selected Scale** - Scale your armature to 1.0 while updating your selected animations to work with the new scale, ideal for resolving export issues related to scale.",
    "**Clamp** - Add keyframes so your active action matches the timeline minimum and maximum, as required by engines that need keyframes defined across the full timeline.",
    "**Snap** - Align your action so that the first keyframe starts at frame 0.",
    "**Automatic Timeline Control** - Define per-action timelines that update automatically when you change actions.",
    "**Asset Library with Viewport Icon** - Take a snapshot of your viewport and use it as the asset library icon, making batch action creation much easier.",
    "**Remove Actions from UI** - Choose between clearing an action (the default Blender behavior) or fully removing it from your blend file."
