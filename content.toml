  parameters = [
    "**Threshold** — Concavity tolerance. Lower = more cuts/tighter hulls; higher = fewer, coarser hulls. Typical 0.03–0.20.",
    "**Max Convex Hulls** — Upper limit on number of hull pieces to output.",
    "**Resolution** — Voxel grid detail for preprocessing and CoACD; higher = more detail, slower.",
    "**Max Hull Vertices** — Per-hull vertex cap after simplification.",
    "**Merge Sub-Hulls** — Merge adjacent sub-hull components when possible.",
    "**Inflate Thickness** — Inflate mesh faces before voxelization. Set to 0 to disable.",
    "**Min Volume Threshold** — Minimum volume for creating a hull; smaller pieces are discarded.",
    "**MCTS Nodes/Iterations** — Search breadth and effort; higher can improve fit at the cost of time.",
  ]

  usage_title = "Usage"
  usage_steps = [
    "**Select** one or more mesh objects.",

    "Post-Processing — **Mirror Collision Objects**: mirror across X/Y/Z with center threshold.",
    "Post-Processing — **Combine Colliders**: merge selected collision hulls into one.",
    "Post-Processing — **Generate LODs**: create multiple LOD levels via decimation; configure levels and ratios in the panel.",
