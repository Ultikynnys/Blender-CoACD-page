      "**3. Install Tools** - Click the **Install Tools** button. This installs necessary scripts into your game engine project.",
      "**4. Enable Plugin** - **Godot/Unreal only**: Open your game project settings and enable the installed UltiBridge plugin. (Unity does this automatically).",
      "**5. Export** - The 'Send to [Engine]' button is now available. Click to start export. Large scenes may take time.",
      "**6. Import** - Once Blender finishes, open/focus the target engine window to trigger the import process.",
