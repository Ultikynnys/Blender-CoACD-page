    "**UltiBake** is a complete replacement for Blender's baking workflow, developed specifically for **game development**. Battle-tested with various asset packs and users, it handles even the most complicated scenes with ease.",
    "Perfect for asset creators working with **Unreal Engine**, **Unity**, or **Godot**, UltiBake streamlines the entire baking process for industry-standard pipelines. It handles **multiple materials per model** and **automatic UV map selection** - no more manual setup. The addon handles all the unintuitive Blender stuff, allowing you to **focus on assets**.",
    "UltiBake can handle **multiple assets at once** - something even Substance Painter or Marmoset can't handle efficiently. Batch process entire asset collections with a single click."

  parameters = [
    "**Modular Design Pattern** - Stores bakes in hierarchical reusable containers called Bake Sets for organized workflows.",
    "**Finalize** - Instantly creates export-ready objects with automatic texture material creation. Makes exporting to other pipelines a breeze.",
    "**GLTF Exporter** - Instantly export baked textures/materials and objects into a glb file.",
    "**Automatic Texture Name Generation** - Texture names are automatically generated based on texture contents, saving you time.",
    "**Advanced Material Support** - As long as your material uses the Principled BSDF node, even the most complicated materials can be baked into textures.",
    "**Collection Baking** - Bake entire collections into a single texture as long as UVs aren't overlapping.",
    "**Decal Baking** - Unique feature! Apply decals to your desired object's surface. Support for decal addons like decalMACHINE, DecalMaster, TrimFlow, Sanctus Library and [UltiStamp](https://superhivemarket.com/products/ultistamp).",
    "**Multi High to Low Baking** - Transfer surface details from high-poly to low-poly meshes. You can bake as many high-to-low combinations as you wish with one click!",
    "**Profiles** - Create your own bake setup profile. You can also save/load to external files for other projects.",
    "**Bake Post Processing** - Apply antialiasing, denoising, sharpening and more.",
    "**Visualizers** - UV and Cage/Extrusion visualizers allow you to see information you would normally have to guess, like overlapping UVs and baking ray distances.",
    "**Multi Texture Channel Packed Baking** - Bake multiple textures with a single click while having Full Control over texture channels with 35 unique bake types.",
    "**ATLAS Baking** - Create ATLAS textures with a single click. You can make your own PBR decals or Texture Atlases for your platform of choice."
